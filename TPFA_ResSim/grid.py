"""Tools for working with model grid coordinates.

Most functions here are barely in use, mostly serving as reference.
After all, it is surprisingly hard to remember
which direction and index is for x and which is for y.

The index ordering is "C-style" (numpy default).
This choice means that `x` is the 1st coord., `y` is 2nd,
and is hardcoded in the reservoir simulator model code
in what takes place **between** `np.ravel` and `np.reshape`
(both of which are configured to use row-major index ordering).
Conveniently, it also means that `x` and `y` tend to occur in alphabetic order.
Thus, in printing a matrix of a field, the `x` coordinate corresponds to the row index.
By contrast, the plotting module depicts `x` from left to right, `y` from bottom to top.
Implementing support for "F-style" (column-major) indexing is possible,
but would imply an undue amount hassle.
